          <h3>Welcome to Rahul Rout's Pages.</h3>

<p>This page is for the compilation of different visualization techniques and UI technologies that I am working on. Most of these samples are using sample generated data sets. You could clone my repository using a git clone.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/routrahul/routrahul.github.io.git
</code></pre>


<h3>Samples</h3>

<p>A few handy samples have been done for reference</p>
<ul>
  <li>
      <h4><a href="/DynamicLayoutReporting/index.html">Dynamic Layout Reporting Solution</a></h4>
      <p>This example is my version of creating a dynamic layout with the help of gridster. This layout gives us the freedom to dynamically change the position, size and dimenson of content inside. I have used NVD3 fro the charting solution and we can use the small option button on the top left corner of each widget to change the chart type dynamically in the client side itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h4><a href="/gridLayout/index.html">Responsive Grid Layout</a></h4>
      <p>This example is my version of creating a responsive grid layout (like the ones used in Pinterest etc). You can resize the window to see the grids realign hemselves based on the size of the page available. This example uses an open source library called Gridster to create and arrange the grids.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h4><a href="/Globe/index.html">Three Dimensional Population Migration Visualization</a></h4>
      <p>This is my attempt to build a three dimensional globe with Population migration data for 2010. Its still a work in progress, so please send in your feedback at <a href="mailto:rout.rahul@gmail.com">rout.rahul@gmail.com</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h4><a href="/Force/force.html">Simple Correlation Graph</a></h4>
      <p>This correlation graph is plotted using d3.js library which uses the Force Layout provided. This graph regenerates the graph with new correlation values without destroying the graph's nodes.The force layout uses the Barnes Hut algorithm to calculate the positions of the nodes and corresponding links. The force layout then calculates the relative positions of the nodes for each tick movement of any of the elements in the graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h4><a href="/Plots/Plot.html">Simple Plot Graph</a></h4>
      <p>This plotting graph is useful when the coordinates of the nodes are known and we need to plot them in a graph area. The links positions for their source and targets is calculated based on the coordinates received for their nodes. The graph is dynamic enough to calculate the relative positions of the nodes for a very varied data range of data sets received.This is highly recomended when a plotting algorithm is used on a data set and the output is to be visualized. This graph too is made in d3.js</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h4><a href="/3d/3d.html">Three Dimensional Correlation Graph</a></h4>
      <p>This graph is a three dimensional correlation graph which is generated with sample coordinates. The links represent correlation values between the different sets of nodes. This graph uses WebGl rendering with the help of the awsome "three.js" library.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h4><a href="/push/index.html">Push Notifications</a></h4>
      <p>This example is my version of creating a dynamic layout with the help of gridster. This layout gives us the freedom to dynamically change the position, size and dimenson of content inside. I have used NVD3 fro the charting solution and we can use the small option button on the top left corner of each widget to change the chart type dynamically in the client side itself.</p>

      <h4><a href="/Console/index.html">Javascript Console on the Browser</a></h4>
      <p>A javascript console on the browser can be useful in different scenarios, can be useful on mobile devices where running javascript code and seeing the output is difficult, can be used to have a handy console ready incase web inspector is not available. I am still working on getting the auto suggest and history to work. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <h4><a href="/MobileAppDemo/gbiportal.html">A Mobile App Navigation Demo Made without using any plugins</a></h4>
      <p>This demo is prepared to suit mainly the webkit browsers AKA the apple handheld devices. However this demo provides us a simplistic view of making mobile apps without using any plugins.</p>
